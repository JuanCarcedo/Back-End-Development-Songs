## IBM Skills Network - Intro to the project
The starting point of this project can be found here [IBM Project](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/hvlga-Back-End-Development-Songs). This is a template (not a fork).  
I implemented the necessary code to make this project work (initial structure given, please check the repository).

Changes:
+ backend/routes.py

### Background
Your client has asked you to build a website for a famous band. The backend developer on the project has recently left, and you need to finish the code so the website can go live. The application consists of some different microservices working together.  
In this part of the project, the development of a songs microservice in Flask is shown.

This microservice works with MongoDB database to store lyrics of the most popular songs of the band.

_This is only the Songs' management._
